# Automatic Hen House 🐔🏡

This is the web page for the group project I completed during my final year of high school (STI2D). The project involves the creation of an automatic hen house, providing information about who worked on the educational project, who carried it out, and where it is located.

Unfortunately, we were unable to implement all the functional components, such as observing the hens using a surveillance camera and accessing hygrometric sensors, due to time constraints and limited knowledge.
